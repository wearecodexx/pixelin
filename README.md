# PIXELIN
http://wearecodex.com/pixelin/ 

Pixelin is an experiment to create pixelart using only HTML and CSS.
It has a few lines of jQuery to be able to change the shape of the "pixels" to square or rounded; also the necessary function to change the colors using  color picker by [jscolor](http://jscolor.com/download/).

The goal with this project is to let see programers and designers that actual pieces of art can be created with code. And the simplest of code, very easy to learn and to experiment with.
